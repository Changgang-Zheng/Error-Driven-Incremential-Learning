The realization of paper ‘Error Driven Incremental Learning (Error-Driven Incremental Learning)’

* remember to chage the data address: 'root_path' in dataset.py
* Change: 'Determine which dataset to be used ================ cifar-10/cifar-100'
* Change: 'The number of pre-train steps ================== when final test, make it bigger'
* Change: 'The number of test batch steps in a epoch ================= when final test, make it bigger'
